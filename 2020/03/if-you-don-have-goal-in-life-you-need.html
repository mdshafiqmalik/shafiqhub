  <p>To set a goal it is very important to understand STG(Short Term Goal) and LTG(Long Term Goal). Let's cover the goals in this articles today.
     Some few points to set a goal in life and tips to achieve it.<br>
<br><b>Step 01.</b> Write STGs and LTG on a blank paper in the way given below.
<br><b>Step 02.</b> Punch a date for completion of that goal.
<br><b>Step 03.</b> Tag it to a place where it is visible to you in most of your time.
<br><b>Step 04.</b> Share it with your friends and public.
<br><b>Step 05.</b> Track record of your task performance.
  Firstly let's get the clear concept of Short Term Goals and Long Term Goals;
</p>
  <p>
    <b>STG</b> stands for Short Term Goals, these are the goals which are directly responsible for the achievement of our main goal. We can say it as the division of main goal. It is important to set short term goals to become more confident and experienced. It is not possible to become successful in a single night. To become successful we need to pain ourselves and be patient. We need to take a dose of pain daily to make ourselves strong. It will some time to acquire and adapt the habit of thinking about goals. You will directly understand your main goal, if you implement STG approach in your life.

    For example if someone try to become a web developer then definitely he have to learn some of the programming languages and  algorithms. He could not master all the programming language at once he need to learn all the programming language one by one or according to the need. From the prospectus of goal setting all the programming languages act as short term goals that a programmer need to learn in order to make himself as a web developer.     Students can implement STG's in their education to tackle the biggest problem in a easy way. This is also known as modular approach to set and achieve a goal. Lets understand it with another example. If we are given to solve following mathematical problem....<br><br>
    5+34 - 45+56 x 67 = ?<br><br>
    To solve it we need to split it into four fragments according to DMAS. To get the answer of this equation we will split this equation. In the same way to reach to our goal we need to break our goal
    into its subdivisions. In this way finding and achieving the goal will become easier. Short term goals are goals for short duration maybe for a week or for some days. In short terms goals we should set little tasks to be done in a given time. Solving small problems and tasks make a man internally strong and confident then ever.
    A date of completion should be written on the paper for short term goal. It make your speed and realization to complete that particular task for which are struggling.
    <br><br>
    <b>LTG</b> stands for Long Term Goal, we can say it our permanent goal. The short term goals are the subdivision of this goal. This goal is a long duration goal it may be take several months or several years. Long terms goal are essential for our daily basis. We can set our long term goal as our aim of life for example Doctor, Mercedes, Modal, Software Engineer, Successful businessman or any thing else.
  </p>
<img src="../../assets/images/posts/2020/stgltg/2.jpg" alt="LTG Long term goals">
  <p>
    Long term goals are the goals or single goal which can only be achieved by completing our short term goal. We should have a sharp focus on short term goals and they should be related to the goal or aim of your life. After completing every task written in short term goals you will feel nearer to the long term goal or your aim.
    It is very difficult to stay focused on a single goal or aim in one's life. So you need commitment, it is the only thing that will make you work for your goal. If you are committed yo your work, you will not forget your aim of life.
